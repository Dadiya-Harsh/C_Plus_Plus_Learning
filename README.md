# C++ Learning Repository

Welcome to my C++ learning journey! This repository contains my progress, notes, and practice code as I explore the C++ programming language.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- Text editor or IDE (VS Code recommended)

### Compilation and Execution

To compile and run any C++ file in this repository:

```bash
# Compile
g++ -o program_name source_file.cpp

# Run
./program_name
```

For example, to run the hello world program:

```bash
g++ -o hello_world "hello world/hello_world.cpp"
./hello_world
```

## 📖 Learning Topics Covered

### Core Concepts (`core_v/`)

- **Basic I/O Operations**: Using `cout` and `cin` for input/output
- **Comments**: Single-line (`//`) and multi-line (`/* */`) comments
- **Compilation Process**: Understanding how C++ code is compiled and executed
- **Error Handling**: Common compilation errors and warnings
- **Statements and Functions**: Basic program structure

### Practice Programs

- **Hello World**: Classic first program demonstrating basic output
- **Main Program**: Extended example with multiple output statements

## 🛠️ Development Environment

This repository is configured with VS Code settings:

- `.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json`: C++ IntelliSense configuration
- `.vscode/tasks.json`: Build tasks configuration

## 📝 Notes

- All learning notes are stored in `.txt` files for easy reference
- Compilation artifacts are preserved to understand the build process
- Code examples progress from basic to more advanced concepts

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- [ ] Master C++ fundamentals (variables, data types, operators)
- [ ] Understand object-oriented programming concepts
- [ ] Learn memory management and pointers
- [ ] Explore STL (Standard Template Library)
- [ ] Practice with real-world projects
